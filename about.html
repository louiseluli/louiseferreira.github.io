                Hi, I'm Louise — and this is the unfiltered version
              </h2>

              <p>
                You know those bios that make everything sound inevitable? Like
                someone always knew exactly where they were going? This isn't
                that. My path to AI research has been messy, full of doubt, and
                shaped by experiences that had nothing to do with Python or
                neural networks.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm a Black, queer woman from Mesquita in Baixada Fluminense — a
                place most people in tech have never heard of, but one that
                taught me everything about what it means when systems don't see
                you. When algorithms don't account for people like you. When
                "objective" technology somehow manages to be anything but.
              </p>

              <div class="pullquote">
                <p>
                  "I didn't come to AI to build cool things. I came because I
                  got tired of being an afterthought in other people's
                  'innovations.'"
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                So yeah, that's the lens I bring to this work. Not just the
                technical chops (though I've got those), but the lived
                experience of navigating spaces that weren't built with me in
                mind. And that combination? That's what drives everything you'll
                see in my research.

                <h3>Mesquita, Baixada Fluminense</h3>
                <p>
                  Growing up in Baixada wasn't the tech origin story people
                  expect. No coding camps or robotics clubs. But it gave me
                  something more important: an understanding of what happens
                  when you're invisible to the people making decisions that
                  affect your life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I watched my community get reduced to crime statistics. Saw
                  friends with brilliant minds never get the chance to prove it.
                  That's where my obsession with fairness started — long before
                  I knew what an algorithm was.

                <h3>International Relations & Finding My Voice</h3>
                <p>
                  I started studying International Relations at UFSC thinking
                  I'd work in diplomacy or policy. Turns out, I was actually
                  learning how power works — who gets heard, who gets ignored,
                  and how systems perpetuate inequality even when people running
                  them think they're being neutral.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That critical lens? It stuck with me. And later, when I got
                  into tech, I realized algorithms are just policy written in
                  code.

                <h3>Poland, Culture, & Starting to Connect the Dots</h3>
                <p>
                  Moving to Poland for my MA in Cultural Studies was when things
                  started clicking. I was studying how culture shapes identity,
                  how narratives get constructed, who gets to tell stories and
                  who gets written out of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the same time, I was watching AI systems make the same
                  mistakes — erasing marginalized voices, encoding bias as
                  "objectivity," treating complex humans like data points. I
                  couldn't unsee the parallel.

                <h3>Falling Into Tech (Kind Of)</h3>
                <p>
                  Cybersecurity wasn't some grand plan. I needed a job, and EY
                  was hiring. But working in data loss prevention and compliance
                  — GDPR, LGPD, all those alphabet soup regulations — taught me
                  something crucial:
                  <em
                    >technical solutions without ethical frameworks are just
                    expensive ways to automate harm</em
                  >.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also realized I was good at this. Really good. Not just the
                  technical stuff, but understanding the human side — why
                  certain communities need protection, what "security" means
                  when you've historically been surveilled instead of
                  safeguarded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Working at Revolut, CloudWalk, and other fintech companies
                  showed me how fast tech moves — and how often ethics gets left
                  in the dust.
                </p>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article class="timeline-item" data-aos="fade-up">

                <h3>The Moment It All Made Sense</h3>
                <p>
                  Here's the thing nobody tells you: sometimes your research
                  topic finds you because you stumble into something that pisses
                  you off enough to do something about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For me, it was seeing how content moderation algorithms
                  penalize LGBT creators and sex workers — disproportionately,
                  "objectively," algorithmically. Terms that should be neutral
                  got flagged as inappropriate. Queer content got shadowbanned.
                  And everyone just shrugged like "well, that's the AI."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nah. That's bias. That's human prejudice at scale. And
                  suddenly, everything I'd learned — cultural studies, policy,
                  tech, my own lived experience — clicked into place. I could
                  actually <em>do</em>
                  something about this.
                </p>

                <h3>Building the Future I Want to See</h3>
                <p>
                  Right now, I'm finishing my MSc in AI at the University of
                  Essex as a Chevening/Lemann Scholar. My research focuses on
                  algorithmic fairness in adult content classification —
                  basically, teaching machines not to be bigots.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it's bigger than that. I'm working on cultural data
                  mining, building datasets for underrepresented communities,
                  and trying to prove that intersectional analysis isn't just a
                  "soft skill" — it's a technical necessity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think the best way to fix broken systems is to build better
                  ones. And I've got ideas.

              <h3>Queer in Tech</h3>
              <p>
                Being openly queer in tech spaces — especially as a Black woman
                from Brazil — means constantly translating yourself. Explaining
                why certain "edge cases" matter. Why content moderation that
                targets LGBT language isn't a bug, it's oppression with a better
                UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                My queerness isn't separate from my research. It <em>is</em> my
                research. When I talk about bias in classification systems, I'm
                talking about algorithms that would flag me.

              <p>
                I'm from Mesquita. I'm Black. I'm Brazilian. And I refuse to
                minimize any of that to make people comfortable. These aren't
                fun facts about me — they're the reason I understand what's at
                stake when AI systems fail.
              </p>
              <p>
                My community taught me resilience. My identity taught me what
                bias looks like in practice. And my work? That's me fighting
                back with code.

              <h3>Global Experiences, Local Heart</h3>
              <p>
                I've lived in three countries, studied in four universities,
                worked across continents. But home is still Baixada. Always will
                be.
              </p>
              <p>
                That tension — between global ambition and local roots — keeps
                me grounded. I don't want to build AI for Silicon Valley. I want
                to build AI for the people who get left behind when tech "moves
                fast and breaks things."

                  that 2% comes at the expense of marginalized communities.

                  That's why I mentor, why I do DEI work, why I refuse to "make

              Messy, multidisciplinary, maybe a little too passionate about
              making sure algorithms don't screw over the people I love. I
              didn't take the traditional path to AI research, and honestly? I'm
              glad. Because the field needs people who understand that
              technology isn't neutral — it's as biased as the humans who build
              it.
            </p>
            <p class="closing-text">
              My job is to make it less biased. My mission is to prove that
              intersectional, justice-driven AI isn't just possible — it's
              necessary.

              if you want to talk about any of this — hit me up. I'm always down
              for a conversation about building better systems.
