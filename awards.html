              I'm not gonna lie — imposter syndrome is real. Some days I still
              can't believe I'm here, doing this work, getting recognized for
              it. But these awards? They're not just about me. They're about the
              people who saw potential when I didn't, the communities that
              lifted me up, and the responsibility I now carry to do the same
              for others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every scholarship, every award, every leadership role came with a
              quiet voice in my head asking "why me?" This page is my answer:
              because I'm not done fighting for fairer systems. And apparently,
              some people think that's worth supporting.

              Look, I could frame all of this as "building my resume" or "career
              advancement." But that would be bullshit.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every scholarship I received came with the weight of everyone who
              didn't get it. Every leadership role came with the responsibility
              to not screw it up for the next person. Every award reminded me
              that I'm not just representing myself — I'm representing every
              queer Black woman from the Global South who's been told they don't
              belong in tech.

              "Success isn't about collecting trophies. It's about using
              whatever platform you've been given to make the ladder easier to
              climb for the people behind you."

              That's what drives me. Not awards. Not recognition. The knowledge
              that other people like me might see my work and think "if she can
              do it, maybe I can too."
            </p>

            <p>And honestly? That's the only award that matters.</p>
